# Artificial Intelligence Course Labs

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the labs of the Artificial Intelligence course designed for the undergraduate degree in Information Technology Engineering at [University Name]. This 16-week course is designed to provide you with hands-on experience and in-depth understanding of fundamental AI topics. The labs include both coding exercises and project-based activities, using Python as the preferred language and Visual Studio Code as the integrated development environment (IDE).

## Table of Contents

1. [Week 1-2: Introduction to Python and Linear Regression](week1-2/)
   - **Objective**: Familiarize yourself with Python basics and implement a simple linear regression model.

2. [Week 3-4: Logistic Regression and Classification](week3-4/)
   - **Objective**: Understand logistic regression and delve into binary classification problems.

3. [Week 5-6: Artificial Neural Networks](week5-6/)
   - **Objective**: Explore the basics of neural networks and implement a simple feedforward neural network.

4. [Week 7-8: Supervised Learning](week7-8/)
   - **Objective**: Gain hands-on experience with various supervised learning algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods.

5. [Week 9-10: Unsupervised Learning](week9-10/)
   - **Objective**: Dive into unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction.

6. [Week 11-12: Reinforcement Learning](week11-12/)
   - **Objective**: Learn the basics of reinforcement learning and implement a simple reinforcement learning agent.

7. [Week 13-14: Deep Learning and Computer Vision](week13-14/)
   - **Objective**: Understand the principles of deep learning and apply them to computer vision tasks.

8. [Week 15: MLOps](week15/)
   - **Objective**: Explore the integration of machine learning models into the software development lifecycle using MLOps practices.

9. [Week 16: Business Intelligence, Ethics, and Regulations](week16/)
   - **Objective**: Engage in a podcast-style discussion on the ethical considerations and regulatory aspects of artificial intelligence in business intelligence.
